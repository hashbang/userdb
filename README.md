## Contribution ##

Please consider the following when submitting contributions:

  - Observe the [Design Requirements].
  - Update the [Design Documentation] whenever designing new features
	or modifying their implementation.
  - Follow the [SQL Style Guide].
  - Use Pull Requests for all changes.
  - Pull Requests are only merged when all tests pass **when merged with
	master**. This is [the “not rocket science” rule] of software.
  - When designing new features, add tests for them right away.

Feel free to reach out to us with ideas or to get help contributing. We
are totally happy with something taking longer to do, if you learn
something in the process. It is the reason #! exists.
